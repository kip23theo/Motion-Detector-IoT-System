#  Motion Detector, CCTV, and Siren IoT Smart Devices Simulation

This project demonstrates an IoT-based security system using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It automatically detects motion, turns ON a siren and CCTV camera, and turns them OFF when no motion is detected.

---

##  Aim
To design and simulate an IoT-based security system that uses a motion detector to trigger a siren and activate CCTV in real-time, providing automated surveillance and alerts.

---

##  Problem Statement
Traditional surveillance systems rely on manual monitoring, which is slow and error-prone.  
This project builds an automated **Intruder Detection System** that immediately responds to motion detection events by sounding an alarm, activating CCTV, and notifying users.

---

##  Scope of the Solution
- **Automation:** Detects motion and activates security devices automatically.
- **Notification:** Real-time alert through simulation (CCTV feed + siren).
- **Scalable:** Additional sensors or cameras can be added.
- **Cost-Effective:** Fully simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer, no real hardware required.

##  Required Components

### Software
- Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x or higher)

### Hardware (Virtual)
- Home Gateway (IoT Controller)
- Motion Detector (PIR Sensor)
- Siren (Alarm)
- CCTV Camera (IoT Webcam)
- Tablet / PC (Optional for monitoring)

### IoT Rules
![IoT Rules](screenshots/iot_rules.png)

**Rules Configured:**
1. **IF** Motion Detector = ON → Turn ON Siren + Turn ON CCTV  
2. **IF** Motion Detector = OFF → Turn OFF Siren + Turn OFF CCTV

##  Demo
1. Open `motion_detector_simulation.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer  
2. Connect devices to the gateway  
3. Trigger **Motion Detector** (Simulation Mode → Click "Detect Motion")  
4. Observe:
   - Siren turns ON
   - CCTV starts streaming

## ✅ Output
- **Motion Detected:** Siren ON + CCTV ON
- **No Motion:** Siren OFF + CCTV OFF
